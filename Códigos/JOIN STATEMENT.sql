-- exemplo de where
select * from employee, work_on where Ssn = Essn;

select * from employee join work_on;


-- JOIN ON -> INNER JOIN ON
select * from employee join work_on on ssn = essn;

select Fname, Lname, Address
	from (employee join departament on Dno=Dnumber)
    where Dname = Programador;

select Dname as Department, Mgr_start_date, Dlocation as Location
	from departament inner join dept_locations using (Dnumber)
    order by Department;

-- project, work_on e employee
select concat(Fname, ' ', Lname) as Nome, Ssn as Identificador, Sex, Salary, Pname as NameProjeto, Pno, Plocation from employee
	inner join work_on on Ssn = Essn
    inner join project on Pno = Pnumber
    where Pname like 'S%'
    order by Pnumber;

-- departament, dept_location e employee
select * from departament
